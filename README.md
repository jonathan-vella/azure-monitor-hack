# Azure monitor automation workshop / What-The-Hack

What the hack structure initiative to enable partners to understand automation and monitoring options in [Azure](https://portal.azure.com) through
different tools and mechanisms solving challenges, which will help them understand their application and workloads even
better and to solve common challenges with [automation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/automation/) and [monitoring](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/overview), including:

1. Automating deployments and practicing DevOps principles going from on-premise to the cloud with modernization in mind
2. Detect and diagnose issues across applications and dependencies with Application Insights.
3. Correlate infrastructure issues with VM insights and Container insights.
4. Drill into your monitoring data with Log Analytics for troubleshooting and deep diagnostics.
5. Support operations at scale with automated actions.
6. Create visualizations with Azure dashboards and workbooks.
7. Collect data from monitored resources by using Azure Monitor Metrics.
8. Investigate change data for routine monitoring or for triaging incidents by using Change Analysis.
